# Data Science Projects

This repository contains my various data science and machine learning projects, showcasing skills in data preprocessing, model building, evaluation, and visualization.

## Projects

### ✈️ Airline Passenger Satisfaction Classification

Led a 5-member team in a machine learning project to classify airline passenger satisfaction (`Satisfied` or `Not Satisfied`) using a dataset with over 120,000 samples and 23 features.

- Conducted full data preprocessing (scaling, binarization, null handling, duplicate removal)
- Performed feature selection using Chi-squared analysis and Recursive Feature Elimination
- Built and tuned multiple models (Logistic Regression, SVM, XGBoost, AdaBoost, Random Forest, Decision Trees, Neural Network, KNN) using Grid Search
- Achieved **96% accuracy** on the best performing model
- Created visualizations to highlight key satisfaction drivers
