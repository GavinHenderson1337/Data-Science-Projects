# Airline Passenger Satisfaction Classification

## Overview

This project classifies airline passenger satisfaction (`Satisfied` or `Not Satisfied`) using a machine learning pipeline applied to a dataset of over 120,000 records with 23 features. The goal was to build a high-performing model while providing interpretable insights into the key drivers of passenger satisfaction.

## Team

Led by a team of 5 students as part of a Machine Learning coursework project.

## Dataset

- **Size:** 120,000+ samples
- **Features:** 23 numerical and categorical variables
- **Target:** Passenger satisfaction (`Satisfied` or `Not Satisfied`)

## Key Tasks

### ðŸ”§ Data Preprocessing
- Feature scaling and binarization
- Handling null values
- Duplicate record removal
- Chi-squared statistical tests
- Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) for feature selection

### ðŸ“Š Model Development
Models trained and tuned using **Grid Search**:
- Logistic Regression
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- XGBoost
- AdaBoost
- Random Forest
- Decision Tree
- Neural Network
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

### âœ… Results
- Best model achieved **96% accuracy**
- Visualizations created to highlight important satisfaction factors

## Visualizations

Insightful charts and plots were created to:
- Interpret model outputs
- Highlight the most influential features
- Explore data distributions and class balance

## Technologies Used

- Python (pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, xgboost, seaborn, matplotlib)
- Jupyter Notebooks
- Git/GitHub for version control and collaboration
